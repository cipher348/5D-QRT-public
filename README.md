# The Joy Of Math: 5D-QRT-public

### DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17541628

Welcome to **5D-QRT-public**, a Python-powered exploration of advanced mathematical structures, resonance physics, spiral phase analysis, and discrete simulation. This repository is designed as a living compendium of theoretical, computational, and visual insights at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and complexity.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

- **Spiral Phase & Resonance Analysis:**  
  Symbolic and numerical analysis of spiral and phase factors, including their algebraic structure and geometric manifestations.

- **Wavefront & Lattice Simulations:**  
  State-of-the-art numerical schemes for propagating wavefronts and signals on discrete lattices, with clear connections to physical limits (CFL), damping models, and resonance.

- **Analytical Bridges & Scripts:**  
  Extensive library of scripts performing curiosity-driven experiments on topics such as log-periodic damping, qoppa constants, log-spirals, and front speed observations.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Language

- **Python 100%**
- Recall that all simulation, analysis, and visualization is implemented in robust, well-documented Python.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.8
- Core scientific stack: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `sympy`
- For some visualizations: `seaborn`

Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy seaborn
```

### Running a Script

Pick any script (e.g. `lattice_wavefront_propagation_simulation.py`) and run:

```bash
python lattice_wavefront_propagation_simulation.py
```

Many scripts will plot results and print key numerical findings to the console.
